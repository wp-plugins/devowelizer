The Devowelizer plugin filters profanity, replacing the vowels in most bad language within your own pages and posts, and from comments.

== Description ==

The Devowelizer plugin provides visual profanity filtering, without censoring or redaction. Devowelizer replaces the vowels in most bad language within your own pages and posts, and from comments. If the word "devowelizer" was a swear word, it would appear as "dëvøwëlìzër".
